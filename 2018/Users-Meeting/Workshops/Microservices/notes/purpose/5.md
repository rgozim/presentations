#### Small, independently deployable, modular services
- Breaks down the moniflic application concept and results in small components

#### Scalable
- Components can be updated and deployed individually
- That means new components can be added into the system independently, or components can be replaced or removed without disrupting the system.  
- The advandage of this - new features can be released into the system as soon as they're ready

#### Reduced complexity
- Becuase they're small and independant, microservice deployment is easy
- Coding a microservice is also easy
